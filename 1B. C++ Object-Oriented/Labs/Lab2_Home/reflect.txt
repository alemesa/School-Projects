Reflection:
1. On this lab we used private and public members:
We declared some private variables and to access we used the public functions 
inside the same class that were using those variables.
Because that's the only way to access it without using a friend
We also used function overload with the example of the display function
we used default values set up to true and true as parameters, but
the function was called using almost every possibility.

2.
I think is the same doing this
do {
} while (a < 10 && cout << "message");

or doing this
do {
    if (a < 10)
        cout << "message";
} while (a < 10);

I think that's bad practices because it will create confusion
The logic behind is that cout is another parameter of the while loop 
that returns true always and when the not valid return true it runs
