Q3.1: The workshop opens a file by a fstream is(filename, ios::in); fstream constructor call.  
The program reads the file twice.
The first pass counted the nummber of lines on the file. 
The program allocated a string table of the required size.  
The second pass read the lines into the string table.  
The first pass reads the file until it encountered an EOF (end-of-file) state. 

How do you reset the EOF state so the file can be read in again in the second pass?

CORRECT ANSWER
is.clear()
is.seekg(0)
