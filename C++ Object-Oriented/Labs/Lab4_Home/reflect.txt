1)	What is meant by a safe empty state?  

Safe empty state is when we initialize the variables of an object in a constructor , so that the object has 
a well defined state when is created. Basically we are avoid leaving those variables empty.

  a.	What is the safe empty state in your program?
  
	On our program the safe empty state is declare through the function setEmpty which initilize
	all the elements of the object to 0;
	
  b.	Why did you select this state?
	We select this state because we want to use that data and to avoid breaking the function or 
	the program	we initilalize those to a safety state.
  
  
2)	Describe a case where having multiple Enrollment constructors would simplify the code of clients that use it.
	A case scenario will be to create multiple constructors to handle data input from clients,
	for example if the user doesn't put a certain field, delegate the task to another constructor and so on
	Example:
		struct Student{
			Enrollment(int id) : y(n) {}
			Enrollment() : ID(01) {}
			int id;
		}
