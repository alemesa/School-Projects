1.	Why was it not necessary to create an isEmpty() member function? 
--------->  We don't need to create a function because is easy to check manually. And on the program we check it only 1 time.
2.	What privacy access level did you set for your strength member attribute?
---------> They are all private ready to be accessed by the member function only and not by any other object directly 
3.	How would you modify your solution to make the strength member attribute private?
---------> Is already private
4.	How would your solution need to be modified in order for the SuperHero::display member function object to display the deceased SuperHero’s name?  For example, the function would be modified to print “(name) the deceased superhero!”  Explain in plain English.
---------> I will need to modify the function so it calls the losing Hero by name as is happening for the winning Hero
5.	View line 43 in w8_at_home.cpp file. Why does this compile?  Uncomment lines 47–48. Does it compile now? Explain why or why not?
---------> The program gives me error when I uncomment all those lines , I'm trying to create two different clases that are not defined 
	   , so I'm getting compilation error
