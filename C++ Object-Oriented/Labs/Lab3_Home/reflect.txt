1) What happens to dynamic memory if it is not deallocated?

The Operative System takes that memory back, and adds that space to a list to be used for another resource.
But is stills best practices to clear all the resources after using it, also when you start and allocate memory
practically save that memory for you and those resources are untouchable.

2) What are the two methods of formatting IO stream data?
The <iostream> library uses 4 operators cin, cout, cerr, clog, the two methods for formatting IO stream data are
cin which is the standart input and cout which is the standard output

3) Why was dynamic memory required in the main() function of w3_in_lab.cpp to build the solution? 
We use dinamically memory in that case because is a way of reuse the same section on memory, "the stack", basically
when we allocate memory we run the function that is in the module Weather.cpp and returns something and after we reuse
the same memory location to get a new date, low temperature and high temperature, the memory is constantly overwritten
as the functions returns data and runs again
